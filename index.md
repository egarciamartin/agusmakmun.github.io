I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at Blekinge Institute of Technology, in Sweden. I am working under the project *Scalable resource- efficient systems for big data analytics* funded by the Knowledge Foundation (Sweden), advised by Niklas Lavesson and Håkan grahn. 


# Research Interests
--- 

The main focus of my thesis is on making **machine learning** algorithms more **energy efficiency**. 
In particular, I have studied the energy consumption patterns of **streaming algorithms**, and then proposed new algorithm extensions that reduce their energy consumption. 
Some of my research interests are the following: 

* Energy Efficiency in Machine Learning
* **Green AI**
* High Performance Computing
* Big Data and Streaming Data
* Green Computing

# Organizing / PC / other

I am currently the **1st International Workshop on Energy Efficient Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery**, held in conjunction with ECML-PKDD 2018, in September in Dublin, Ireland. [Green Data Mining](https://greendatamining.github.io)

I am helping at organizing the [WiML](https://wimlworkshop.org) dinner held at ICML, in Stockholm, July 2018. 

I am a reviewer for the following conferences/journals: [WiML](https://wimlworkshop.org), [ICML](https://icml.cc), [ECML](http://www.ecmlpkdd2018.org), [AAAI](https://aaai.org), [SNAM](https://link.springer.com/journal/13278), [GHC](https://ghc.anitab.org).
