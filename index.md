Data Scientist at [Ekkono Solutions](https://ekkono.ai) working on developing and designing sustainable, energy efficient, and low memory footprint machine learning algorithms. 

I successfully defended my PhD in January 2020 at [Blekinge Institute of Technology](https://www.bth.se) (Sweden), advised by [Niklas Lavesson](https://www.bth.se/eng/staff/niklas-lavesson-nla/) and [Håkan Grahn](https://www.bth.se/eng/staff/hakan-grahn-hgr/).
The  PhD was funded by the [Knowledge Foundation](http://www.kks.se) under the project *Scalable resource- efficient systems for big data analytics*. advised by [Niklas Lavesson](https://www.bth.se/eng/staff/niklas-lavesson-nla/) and [Håkan Grahn](https://www.bth.se/eng/staff/hakan-grahn-hgr/).



<!-- The main focus of my thesis is on making **machine learning** algorithms more **energy efficient**.
In particular, I have studied the energy consumption patterns of **streaming algorithms**, and then proposed new algorithm extensions that reduce their energy consumption.
Some of my research interests are the following:
Energy Efficiency in Machine Learning, **Green AI**, High Performance Computing, Big Data and Streaming Data, Green Computing.
