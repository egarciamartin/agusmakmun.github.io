# Energy Efficiency in Machine Learning
## Approaches to Sustainable Data Stream Mining

---
### Abstract

Energy efficiency in machine learning explores how to build machine learning algorithms and models with low computational and power requirements.
Energy efficient and scalable algorithms are necessary to be able to be deployed on embedded systems and other resource constrained devices.
Although energy consumption is starting to gain interest in the field of machine learning, still the majority of solutions focus on obtaining the highest predictive accuracy, without considering energy consumption.

This thesis explores green machine learning, which builds on green computing and computer architecture to design sustainable and energy efficient machine learning algorithms.
In particular, the thesis investigates energy efficiency for data stream mining algorithms.
While data stream mining algorithms are able to process potentially infinite streams of data without incurring in intensive computations, building energy efficient solutions for streams of data is key to move machine learning to battery constraint devices.

This thesis comprises six papers, that address *how to design machine learning algorithms that automatically learn from streaming data in an energy efficient manner*.
This thesis first shows how to extract the energy consumption patterns of an algorithm both theoretically, and empirically. Theoretically though an energy model that maps the number of computations and memory accesses to the main functionalities of the algorithm. Empirically though analyzing the hardware events correlated to the execution of the algorithm, and by analyzing the behavior of the algorithm in terms of energy consumption through functional analysis and parameter tuning.

Second, this thesis proposes a generic approach to reduce the energy consumption of Hoeffding trees and ensembles of Hoeffding trees, a class of streaming algorithms. This approach focuses on the concept of growing the decision tree adaptively and independently for each branch, in the form of two solutions.

The first solution sets a unique value of the *nmin* parameter (minimum batch size at each node) independent for each node. This saves between 20 and 30 percent of energy by delaying the splits on those nodes that have not observed enough data to make a confident split, with minimal effect on accuracy.

The second solution, the Green Accelerated Hoeffding Tree algorithm, grows the tree dynamically by creating different types of nodes which follow different splitting criteria. Thus, growing the tree faster in only a selected set of nodes and deactivating another set of nodes to save energy. This algorithm consumes 20 percent less energy than the state-of-the-art Hoeffding tree extension, while obtaining higher levels of accuracy.

  Energy consumption has been widely studied in the computer architecture field for decades. While the adoption of energy as a metric in machine learning is emerging, the majority of research is still primarily focused on obtaining high levels of accuracy without any computational constraint. We believe that one of the reasons for this lack of interest is due to their lack of familiarity with approaches to evaluate energy consumption. To address this challenge, we present a review of the different approaches to estimate energy consumption in general and machine learning applications in particular. Our goal is to provide useful guidelines to the machine learning community giving them the fundamental knowledge to use and build specific energy estimation methods for machine learning algorithms. We also present the latest software tools that gives energy estimation values, together with two use cases that enhance the study of energy consumption in machine learning.

  Data mining algorithms are usually designed to optimize a trade-off between predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. This paper introduces energy consumption and energy efficiency as important factors to consider during data
  mining algorithm analysis and evaluation. We conducted an experiment to illustrate how energy consumption and accuracy are affected when varying the parameters of the Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT) algorithm. These results are compared with a theoretical analysis on the algorithm, indicating that energy consumption is affected by the parameters design and that it can be reduced significantly while maintaining accuracy.

  Large-scale data centers account for a significant share of
  the energy consumption in many countries. Machine learning technology requires intensive workloads and thus drives requirements for lots of
  power and cooling capacity in data centers. It is time to explore green
  machine learning. The aim of this paper is to profile a machine learning
  algorithm with respect to its energy consumption and to determine the
  causes behind this consumption. The first scalable machine learning algorithm able to handle large volumes of streaming data is the Very Fast
  Decision Tree (VFDT), which outputs competitive results in comparison
  to algorithms that analyze data from static datasets. Our objectives are
  to: (i) establish a methodology that profiles the energy consumption of
  decision trees at the function level, (ii) apply this methodology in an experiment to obtain the energy consumption of the VFDT, (iii) conduct
  a fine-grained analysis of the functions that consume most of the energy,
  providing an understanding of that consumption, (iv) analyze how different parameter settings can significantly reduce the energy consumption.
  The results show that by addressing the most energy intensive part of
  the VFDT, the energy consumption can be reduced up to a 74.3%

  Recently machine learning researchers are designing algorithms that can run in embedded and mobile devices, which introduces additional constraints compared to traditional algorithm design approaches.
  One of these constraints is energy consumption, which directly translates to battery capacity for these devices.
  Streaming algorithms, such as the Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT), are designed to run in such devices due to their high velocity and low memory requirements. However, they have not been designed with an energy efficiency focus.
  This paper addresses this challenge by presenting the nmin adaptation method, which reduces the energy consumption of the VFDT algorithm with only minor effects on accuracy.
  nmin adaptation allows the algorithm to grow faster in those branches where there is more confidence to create a split, and delays the split on the less confident branches. This removes unnecessary computations related to checking for splits but maintains similar levels of accuracy.
  We have conducted extensive experiments on 29 public datasets, showing that the VFDT with nmin adaptation consumes up to 31% less energy than the original VFDT, and up to 96% less energy than the CVFDT (VFDT adapted for concept drift scenarios), trading off up to 1.7 percent of accuracy.

  Energy consumption reduction has been an increasing trend in machine
  learning over the past few years due to its socio-ecological importance. In new challenging areas such as edge computing, energy consumption and predictive accuracy are key variables during algorithm design and implementation. State-of- the-art stream mining algorithms are able to create highly accurate predictions in real-time while adhering to low computational requirements to run in edge devices. This is the case of ensembles of Hoeffding trees. While these algorithms obtain high levels of accuracy, that is done at a substantial energy cost. This paper introduces the nmin adaptation method to ensembles of Hoeffding tree algorithms,
  to further reduce their energy consumption without sacrificing accuracy. We have evaluated the energy efficiency and accuracy of the nmin adaptation
  method on five different ensembles of Hoeffding trees under 11 publicly available datasets.
  The results show that we are able to reduce the energy consumption significantly,
  by 21 % on average, affecting accuracy by less than one percent on average.

  Stream mining algorithms are able to produce highly accurate models in real time, without strong computational demands. This is the case of the Hoeffding tree algorithm. Recent extensions to this algorithm focus on increasing predictive accuracy, but at the cost of a higher energy consumption. This paper presents the Green Accelerated Hoeffding Tree (GAHT) algorithm, which is able to achieve same levels of accuracy as the latest Hoeffding tree extension, i.e. Extremely Very Fast Decision Tree (EFDT), while reducing its energy consumption. In particular, the GAHT algorithm is able to reduce the energy consumption of the EFDT by 26 percent, averaged on 12 publicly available datasets, with minimal effect on accuracy.
